## FriendlyNPCs aka Friendly Vendors
Force all vendors to like you. Or to dislike you, if you're into that.

Get it on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/59).

## StaminaVis aka Stamina Visibility
Allows you to tweak the stamina bar's visibility behavior.

Get it on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/57).

## ToggleAltFire aka Toggle Aim
Toggle aim-down-sights (and other ranged weapon alt-fires). Perhaps more configurable than it ought to be.

Get it on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/60).

## WhichMissions
Adds chat commands to list which mission types you need for the "complete one of each mission type..." penances.
